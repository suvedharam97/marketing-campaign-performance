### Business Problem Statement: Evaluating the Effectiveness of Marketing Campaigns

#### Context:
A company has launched multiple marketing campaigns across different channels and target audiences to improve key performance metrics such as Conversion Rate, ROI, and Acquisition Cost. These campaigns include Email, Influencer Marketing, Display Ads, Social Media, and Search Engine Ads.

#### Business Objectives:
1. **Conversion Rate**: Identify which campaign type drives the highest user sign-ups and determine if there are significant differences in conversion rates across campaigns.
2. **ROI**: Evaluate the return on investment for each campaign type and assess whether certain campaigns are more profitable than others.
3. **Acquisition Cost**: Analyze the cost-effectiveness of each campaign type by comparing acquisition costs.

#### Key Questions:
1. Does the type of marketing campaign influence the **Conversion Rate**?
2. Are there significant differences in **ROI** among the campaign types?
3. Which campaign type is the most cost-effective in terms of **Acquisition Cost**?

#### Approach:
- Use statistical methods such as A/B testing, One-Way ANOVA, and Tukeyâ€™s HSD to compare performance metrics across campaign types.
- Apply Propensity Score Matching (PSM) to control for confounding variables and estimate the causal impact of campaign type on Conversion Rate and ROI.
- Simulate a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to validate findings and ensure robust conclusions.



## **Statistical Tests Used**

1. **A/B Testing**:
    - **Test**: Two-sample t-test.
    - **Objective**: Compare the performance of Influencer campaigns versus Non-Influencer campaigns on **Conversion Rate** and **Acquisition Cost**.
    - **Results**: No statistically significant difference was found (p-values: Conversion Rate = 0.0665).

2. **One-Way ANOVA**:
    - **Test**: Analysis of variance.
    - **Objective**: Compare the means of **Conversion Rate**, **ROI**, and **Acquisition Cost** across multiple campaign types.
    - **Results**: No statistically significant differences were observed across campaign types (p-values: Conversion Rate = 0.4705, ROI = 0.3969, Acquisition Cost = 0.9797).

3. **Causal Inference (Propensity Score Matching)**:
    - **Method**: Propensity Score Matching using logistic regression.
    - **Objective**: Evaluate the causal impact of Campaign Type on **Conversion Rate**, **ROI**, and **Acquisition Cost** by balancing treatment groups (specific campaign types) and controlling for confounding variables.
    - **Methodology**: Propensity Score Matching was applied to ensure comparable groups by matching on key covariates such as demographics, previous engagement, and channel preferences.
    - **Results**:  
        - **Conversion Rate**: Estimated Average Treatment Effect (ATE) = 0.0152 (1.52% increase for targeted campaigns).  No significant difference was found (p_value = 0.96)
        - **ROI**: Estimated ATE = -0.00897 (-0.90% decrease for targeted campaigns).  No significant difference was found (p_value = 0.46)
        - **Acquisition Cost**: Estimated ATE = 0.65 (slight increase in cost for targeted campaigns).  No significant difference was found (p_value = 0.98)


## **Key Insights**

- Statistical tests (A/B Testing and ANOVA) did not find significant differences in performance metrics across campaign types.
- Causal inference analysis did not find statistically significant evidence that Influencer campaigns positively impact **Conversion Rate** or reduce **Acquisition Cost**. Further validation and exploration of alternative strategies are recommended.

## **Potential Next Steps**

1. **Deep Dive into Campaign Data**:
    - Perform segmentation analysis to identify specific audience groups or channels where campaigns may have been more effective.
    - Investigate potential outliers or anomalies in the data that could have influenced the results.

2. **Experimentation with Campaign Design**:
    - Test alternative campaign strategies, such as personalized messaging or dynamic pricing, to improve engagement and conversion rates.
    - Explore the impact of campaign timing and frequency on performance metrics.

3. **Advanced Modeling Techniques**:
    - Use machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict campaign success and identify key drivers of performance.
    - Apply time-series analysis to evaluate trends and seasonality in campaign performance.

4. **Collaboration with Stakeholders**:
    - Share findings with marketing and product teams to align on actionable insights.
    - Develop a roadmap for continuous improvement based on data-driven recommendations.
